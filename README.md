### Supplementary NPM Packages

- JWT - User authentication/Authorization
- Nodemon - Automatically refreshes the back-end server
- Morgan - Backend logging for requests
- Cors - Solves cross-origin issues when connecting front-end and back-end
- Dotenv - Saving and accessing environment variables
- Bcrypt - Password hashing for users
- Express-async-errors - Removes the need to try/catch every backend request in an async function. Automatically sends the error to the express error handling middleware once the error is detected
- ESlint + Prettier - Runs a combination of ESlint + Prettier 
- DaisyUI and HeadlessUI - Both are Tailwind CSS packages that I used to help style my project. The shopping cart sliding concept was taken from TailwindUI
- Zustand - My first time using a state management tool such as Zustand. I wanted to use something to share state across components. I considered other tools such as Redux but ultimately decided to use Zustand because of its simple iterface and its cute bear. The website for it is also amazing
